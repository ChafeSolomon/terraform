# Purpose

This repo goes over all terraform code written by me during my az104 studies. 

-  An active Azure account. If you don't have one, [create an Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
-  Azure CLI installed. You can download and install it from the [official Azure CLI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
